# NF_WeatherDashboard

### Description
Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

- City, Date, Icon-image
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind Speed
- UV index

The 5-days weather forecast also displays below the current weather conditions section and it includes the following information for each day:

- Date
- Icon image
- Temperature
- Humidity

The local storage is used here to store the previous search city and display them to the user in the left side of the page under the list group. The user can also clear the search history by clicking the clear history button.
If the user wants to see the past search city weather condition again, just click the list group item cities under the clear history button.
